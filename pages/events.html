messaging. You have the freedom to communicate what you want, when you want, and to multiple people at once. 

Group messages, however, are an archive of thoughts, and are not optimized for finding a mutual time to get

        <p>Creating an app that lives within the 

context of a Messages conversation introduces unique design constraints. I had to work around the lack of 

screen real estate and think about the existing visual elements that users expect to see within iMessage. 

iMessage apps are typically used in the context of fast-paced, informal conversations. As such, keeping the 

number of interaction steps as low as possible ensures that the organic flow of messaging is not lost. </p>

    <article class="section1 animated">
      <p>The first challenge was creating a simple, minimal 

interface for the calendar’s integration into the app. If we’re trying to figure out when people are 

available, we must look at hours, days, weeks, and maybe even the month to get an accurate picture of one’s 

schedule. I decided to use a “painting” touch gesture so that users can easily “paint” their availability on 

the calendar. This is a visual representation of the organic, fluid flow that is necessary for an unobtrusive 

iMessage app. Also, people may be familiar with this gesture from the most popular scheduling apps, which 

makes it simpler for users to feel comfortable with the app’s flow. Though it is sometime necessary to create 

custom controls, using a pre-established interaction is favorable in this case as the unique value in this 

app does not lie in the calendar by itself. </p>

<li>I used a step-by-step flow for the availability and event creation in order to keep things simple. </li>
<li> Will the inviter’s view look different than the invitee’s view? (only where necessary). </li>
<li>How should people’s responses be visually differentiated? (Stacked opacities of different colors).</li>
<li> Should people “paint” when they are available, or when they are busy? (Available).</li>
<li>Should we display the hours before or after the event is created? (Before, as the time of day is important for any get together). </li>
<li>Will overlaying existing calendar events (iCal) feel out of place for a casual, friends-based event app? (No, it’s important to see all obligations to have an accurate schedule). </li>
</ul>

<article class="section1 animated">
<p>Once the “inviter” sends his/her availability, the event is created. Now, all participants have the option of adding integrations to the event. Though I experimented with multiple 3rd party integrations that make sense for events, I narrowed it down to the following 4 for simplicity and clarity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Photos: Create and be automatically subscribed to a shared album with iCloud Photo Sharing.</li>
<li>Maps: Suggest and vote for the eventʼs location with Maps.</li>
<li>Music: Add a shared Apple Music playlist through MusicKit with your friendsʼ preferences in the mix.</li>
<li>Pay: Send or receive money from individuals through Apple Pay in iOS 11.</li>
